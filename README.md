# HT-Step step detection and captioning (minimal)

Finds the steps of an instructional video and classifies each one among the 4958 steps of the HT-Step taxonomy; the
caption of a segment is the headline of its step. The model is the [UniAV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03179) backbone
(one ConvTransformer stream for video, one for audio, with cross-attention, 6-level pyramid) with an event score, the
step boundaries and the language-aware classifier of UniAV: the segment vector is compared with the text vectors of
the steps. As in [OV-AVEL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11278) a class is only its text, so any list of steps can be
scored at inference (by default the steps of the video's article, as the HT-Step article grounding task), and with
`model.audio_text` the audio stream gets its own step classifier that has to agree with the video one.

Python 3.13 and PyTorch 2.14, the versions of Google Colab. One or several GPUs (DistributedDataParallel).

## Setup

    uv venv -p 3.13 .venv
    VIRTUAL_ENV=.venv uv pip install -r requirements.txt --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130 \
        --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple
    source .venv/bin/activate

On Colab the default runtime already has Python 3.13 and PyTorch; only `pip install huggingface_hub` is needed.

## Data

    python tools/htstep_data.py fetch

clones the official [HT-Step repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/htstep) into `data/htstep` (annotations of
the train / val_seen splits, taxonomy, evaluation script), downloads `step_emb_iv2j.npz` (InternVideo2 text vectors
of `"<activity>: <headline>"` for every step, made by `python tools/htstep_data.py build`) from
`nguyenminh04/htstep-text-feats`, and the k400_f16 features of the annotated videos from `nguyenminh04/htstep-feats-k400`
(train) and `nguyenminh04/htstep-val-seen-feats` (val_seen) into `data/htstep/k400_feats/`. One file per video:
`k768` (InternVideo2-1B K400 f16, 4 fps, ~4 s window) and `a768` (BEATs audio, zeros if the video has no audio), one
row per second. Videos without features are skipped. Needs `HF_TOKEN` in the environment or `.env`.

## Train

    python train.py                               # one GPU
    torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 train.py          # 4 GPUs: one process each, batch_size videos per GPU
    python train.py --eval ckpt/htstep/model_best.pth.tar   # score a checkpoint

Every epoch prints, on val_seen: the loss, R@0.5 (GT steps matched by one of the top-k predictions with IoU >= 0.5),
CIDEr of the captions (headlines) of the matched steps, Acc (matched steps given the right step) and mAP (official
article grounding mAP, tIoU 0.3-0.7, same numbers as `data/htstep/evaluation/eval_article_grounding.py` on the
videos that have features). The checkpoint with the best R@0.5 goes to
`ckpt/htstep/model_best.pth.tar`. Training stops when neither R@0.5 nor CIDEr has improved for `--patience` epochs
(default 3). Other parameters are edited in `libs/core/config.py`.

The omni head (an extra embedding loss against OmniRetriever step vectors, 3584-d) is off while
`dataset.omni_emb_file` is `''`; set it to an npz laid out as `step_emb_iv2j.npz` (`ids`, `emb`) to turn it on.

## Feature pipeline (`tools/pipeline/`)

Downloads the HT-Step videos, extracts the k400_f16 features and uploads one tar of features per chunk
(100 videos) to `nguyenminh04/htstep-feats-k400`. Each machine runs on its own CSV of chunks.

Python, one step each:

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `download_hf.py` | downloads the video shards of the CSV's chunks from HF (`nguyenminh04/htstep-videos`) |
| `download_videos.py` | downloads videos from YouTube with yt-dlp (chunks without a video shard) |
| `extract_features.py` | extracts `k768` + `a768` for every downloaded chunk; `--upload` sends each chunk's tar to HF |
| `upload_partial.py` | uploads the features of an unfinished chunk as a partial tar (with the list of missing videos) |

Shell, one per machine:

| File | Where it runs | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `run.sh CSV` | any machine | starts the three Python steps above in the background for one CSV |
| `colab_dl_launch.sh` | PC | gets a Colab GPU, uploads the pipeline and starts `colab_dl_extract.sh` there |
| `colab_dl_extract.sh` | Colab | installs the dependencies and weights, then `run.sh rest_colab.csv` |
| `colab_keepalive.sh` | PC | keeps the Colab session alive (Colab closes idle CLI sessions) |
| `colab_watchdog.sh` | PC | every 5 min, relaunches `colab_dl_launch.sh` if the Colab extraction died |
| `kaggle_work.sh` | Kaggle | one share per T4 GPU (`shards_part1_kaggle0/1.csv`) |

CSV, one row per chunk (same columns everywhere):

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `shards.csv` | all 205 chunks |
| `shards_part1.csv`, `shards_part2.csv` | the two halves; part 1 is done on our machines |
| `shards_part1_{pc,colab,kaggle0,kaggle1}.csv` | first split of part 1 between the machines |
| `rest_{pc,colab,vast,kaggle}.csv` | current split of what is left of part 1 |
